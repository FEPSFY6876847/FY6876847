            Hurricanes are devastating natural disasters, Hurricanes are another word for tropical cyclone, naturally occurring things that form over tropical and sub-tropical oceans. Wind speeds need to reach a sustained speed of 74mph to be classed as a hurricane and can be 300-500 miles across and 5 or 6 miles high [1]. Hurricanes have caused the most damage out of any natural disaster according to NOAA, with hurricanes accounting for an average of $22.8 Billion per event, adding up to $1.3 Trillion since 1980, and to add to this they have caused around 6890 deaths since 1980 [2].
