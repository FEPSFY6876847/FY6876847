            Abstract
        </h3>
        <p class="margined">
            Hurricanes are upon the worst natural disasters that a country can face, they typically happen where sea temperatures are higher, Florida is the place where the most amount of hurricanes happen per year with a total of 120 hurricanes from 1851 to 2022 [15]. Hurricane Katrina caused a total of $200 Billion of damages [4] where Milton has only caused $50 Billion as of now as it is such a recent hurricane [5]. Katrina killed over 1500 people over the states of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Florida where Milton so far has only caused 10-20+ deaths according to multiple news sources [7]. Katrina reached a low 902mb of pressure, 7th lowest in us history, where Milton has reached a low of 897mb, 5th in us history [9]. Overall, on paper Milton was stronger than Katrina, but due to the US learning their lesson with Katrina they prepared for Milton, resulting in a better outcome than in the past.

            Introduciton
        </h3>
        <p class="margined">
            Hurricanes are devastating natural disasters, Hurricanes are another word for tropical cyclone, naturally occurring things that form over tropical and sub-tropical oceans. Wind speeds need to reach a sustained speed of 74mph to be classed as a hurricane and can be 300-500 miles across and 5 or 6 miles high [1]. Hurricanes have caused the most damage out of any natural disaster according to NOAA, with hurricanes accounting for an average of $22.8 Billion per event, adding up to $1.3 Trillion since 1980, and to add to this they have caused around 6890 deaths since 1980 [2].

            This article is going to be zooming in and comparing 2 different major hurricanes, hurricane Katrina in August 2005, and Hurricane Milton, October 2024, two massive hurricanes that originated in the Gulf of Mexico. Hurricane Katrina is the costliest hurricane to hit the us from the Gulf of Mexico [3].
        </p>
        <h3 class="indented">
            Main body
        </h3>
        <p class="margined">
            Firstly, I’m going to zoom in on costs of each hurricane. Starting with Katrina, it has cost the us $200 Billion as of the 2024 Consumer Price Index [4], this is the costliest hurricane in US history. Onto Hurricane Milton, is has cost $50 Billion so far, as it is so recent [5] these costs are still going up as time goes on as they discover more damages. So far Milton has caused power outages to over 3.3 million people, and destroyed over 150 homes, ripped a roof off of a baseball stadium and toppled a 500ft crane [5]. This is nothing compared to hurricane Katrina, with Katrina destroying over 217,000 homes across the gulf coast, 3 million people were left without electricity for over a week [6] Katrina killed over 1500 people across the states of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Florida. With Milton a full count hasn’t been published yet, but from various sources including the BBC, Forbes, The Guardian, and many more, I’m getting around 10-20+ deaths, this would be due to the hurricane being generally localised compared to Katrina, with the path being only over Florida, whereas Katrina affected states all along the gulf coast, including, Florida, Louisiana, and Mississippi the most affected [7].
        </p>
        
        <p class="margined">
            Next, I’m going to move onto the actual hurricane itself, comparing its speeds, size and path and more. Staring with Katrina the best way to get an idea of how powerful a hurricane will be, is looking at the atmospheric pressure, Katrina reached a low of 902mb, 7th lowest in the US as of September 2022 [8]. Milton reached a low of 897mb, 5th lowest in US history [9]. Milton reached sustained peak windspeeds of 180 mph [10] compared to a 175mph sustained peak windspeed for Katrina [8]. A category 5 hurricane, the category only the strongest hurricanes get put into, requires just 157mph sustained windspeeds [11], both hurricanes have blown this figure out of the water and are almost calling upon a new category to be made just for these types of hurricanes. Hurricanes create a storm surge before they hit, a change in sea level as a result of a storm, they lead to extensive flooding, and a hazard to those who live close to the coast [12]. Hurricane Katrina created a storm surge, which at max was 11.45 feet, and lowest of 4.1 feet [13], where Milton created a storm surge of of 8-10 feet was recorded [14].
        </p>
        <h3 class="indented">
            Conclusion
        </h3>
        <p class="margined">
            Overall, looking at the figures and statistics, it shows that Milton, on paper, was stronger and if you take just the hurricane itself, no damages or deaths, Milton was stronger and looked like it was going to cause more damage. However this wasn’t the case, in fact Katrina still stands as the worst hurricane to hit the US in terms of cost [4]. Most the damage from Milton came from the high windspeeds rather than the flooding. Even though top scientists in the US feared the flooding most. This could be down to the US improving measures against hurricanes and improving the evacuation policies for major cities [16]. And even weeks after the Hurricane, not many people are talking about it, where with Katrina, everyone was talking about it, even now, years later. Clearly Katrina hit the US harder and with more panic than Milton did. 
        </p>
        <p class='margined'>
            As climate change continues to get worse, sea temperatures are going to increase, sea level is going to rise, and the warming of mid latitude areas change. more and more worse hurricanes are going to happen. They will have increased storm surge, increased wind speeds, and decreased pressure in the atmosphere [17]. All pointing to a real bad hurricane. it is important that we learn from hurricanes like Katrina and Milton, and never doubt that a stronger one could come next.
        </p>
        <p class='margined'>
            The contrasting outcomes of these two hurricanes highlight the effectiveness of new hurricane measures, from the preparation to the response and evacuation protocols in the US, are the main reasons for the mitigation of Milton’s worst potential impact. Nonetheless, Katrina’s destruction and impact it had on America, is still being felt today, from politics, society and disaster management. The lessons from Katrina have shaped the path for future hurricane response, but the legacy of Katrina will always be remembered and constantly being learnt upon.
